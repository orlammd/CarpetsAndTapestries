Carpets and Tapestries Staves


------
Dependencies

In order to work as properly as possible, you should install the following programs, so those staves will sound the way they did when they first were written:

- laborejo (partition editor and MIDI sequencer) >= 0.8 (packaged in many distributions)
- calfbox (laborejo module to play and output MIDI)
- Alsa Modular Synth >= 2.0.1-5 (packaged in many distributions), alongside with the patches contained in the AMS_patches directory of this repository: http://github.com/orlammd/Sebkha-Chott_Setup/,
- Tapeutape (http://hitmuri.net/index.php/Software/Tapeutape), alongside with the kits and samples contained in the Samples directory of the pre-cited repository
- Mididings with the python patch you will find soon in this repository
- Qsynth, alongside with Debian packaged soundfonts for Fluid Synth.

How it is cabled?

In this repository, you will find a screenshot of a ladish studio presenting the different connexions needed to make it work. Please note that Jack-Mixer is optionnal, though deeply useful.
